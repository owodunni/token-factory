# Decentralized Exchanges and Automated Market Makers: An Introduction

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and automated market makers (AMMs) are both forms of cryptocurrency exchanges. A
cryptocurrency exchange is a platform that allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies.

Decentralized exchanges are a type of cryptocurrency exchange that operates without a central authority, such as a bank
or government. This means that users can buy and sell cryptocurrencies directly with each other, without the need for a
third party to facilitate the transaction. Because there is no central authority, decentralized exchanges are often
considered to be more secure and resistant to censorship than centralized exchanges.

Automated market makers, on the other hand, are a type of algorithm that automatically sets the prices for
cryptocurrencies on an exchange. Instead of relying on traditional order books, where buyers and sellers place orders at
specific prices, automated market makers use complex mathematical formulas to determine the prices of cryptocurrencies
based on supply and demand. This allows for more efficient and flexible trading, as prices can be adjusted quickly in
response to changes in market conditions.

## Automated Market Makers bonding curve

Automated market makers (AMMs) use a type of pricing model called a bonding curve to determine the prices of
cryptocurrencies on an exchange. A bonding curve is a mathematical formula that describes the relationship between the
supply of a cryptocurrency and its price.

In general, bonding curves work by creating a fixed pool of funds that are used to buy and sell the cryptocurrency. As
more of the cryptocurrency is bought, the price goes up, and as more of it is sold, the price goes down. This allows for
a flexible and dynamic pricing mechanism that can quickly adjust to changes in supply and demand.

Automated market makers use bonding curves to set the prices of cryptocurrencies on an exchange. When a user wants to
buy or sell a cryptocurrency, the AMM uses the bonding curve formula to determine the price at which the transaction
should be executed. This allows for efficient and fair pricing of cryptocurrencies on the exchange.
