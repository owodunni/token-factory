Whenever I send a transaction it always pussles me why the gas estimation is so bad. In most cases I want to send a transaction
that is as cheap as possible, but the gas estimation is always way too high. I can get it down to a more reasonable number by
manually tuning the priority fees. There are tools like [Blocknative Gas Fee Predictor](https://www.blocknative.com/gas-estimator)
that can help you find a descent gas price, it's still a bit of a guessing game.

### Method

In this article we will look at how to answer the questions:

1. How much gas do I need to send a transaction within `X` minutes?
2. Given `gas`, `max_fee_per_gas` and `max_priority_fee_per_gas`, how long will it take for a transaction to get included in a block?

To answer these questions we will do a couple of experiments.

1. What does the distribution of `gas` look like for transactions that are included in a block?
2. How does the distribution of validated transactions compare to the distribution of transactions in the mempool?

## Background

If you are not familiar with EIP-1559 transactions I recommend you read [this article](https://www.blocknative.com/blog/eip-1559-fees).
What you need to know is:

- `gas` is the amount of computational work that needs to be done to execute a transaction. It's determined by how many EVM
  [`opcodes`](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/opcodes/) are executed.
- `base_fee` is the lowest gas price that is accepted by the network. If you set the gas price lower than the base fee your
  transaction will be rejected. The base fee is calculated by the network and is adjusted every block. The `base_fee` is burned.
- `priority_fee` is the amount of ether you are willing to pay on top of the base fee. The higher the priority fee the higher
  the priority of your transaction. Transactions with a higher priority will be included in a block sooner. The `priority_fee`
  goes to the validator.
- `max_fee_per_gas` is the maximum amount of ether you are willing to pay for a unit of gas. This is the total amount of ether
  you are willing to pay for the transaction. If its to low your transaction is not valid for inclusion in any block.
- `max_priority_fee_per_gas` is the amount of ether you are willing to pay for a unit of gas on top of the base fee. If its to
  low no validator will include your transaction in a block.

`max_fee_per_gas` and `max_priority_fee_per_gas` are the parameters you can tune to get the gas price you want. We can se how they
work by reading the [EIP-1559](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md):

```python
priority_fee_per_gas = min(
  transaction.max_priority_fee_per_gas,
  transaction.max_fee_per_gas - block.base_fee_per_gas)
effective_gas_price = priority_fee_per_gas + block.base_fee_per_gas
```

To be continued.
