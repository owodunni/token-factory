# Get started with web3!

Web3 is a new way to interact with the internet. It's a decentralized network of computers that allows you to interact
with dApps (decentralized applications) and smart contracts.
To gain access to web3 you need a wallet and a browser. A wallet is a piece of software that allows you to interact with
web3.

There are many wallets available, but we recommend [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for **desktop**
or [Opera Crypto Browser](https://www.opera.com/crypto/next) for **mobile** when doing our tutorials.

## Try web3 on a testnet

Once you have a web3 wallet setup, you can try it out on a testnet. A testnet is a blockchain network that is used for
testing purposes. Testnets are a great way to learn how to interact with web3 and smart contracts.

To interact with web3 you need to have funds in your wallet. You can get some funds by using a faucet. A faucet is a
website that provides a small amounts of funds for free. You can use the faucet to get some funds to play around with
web3.

Through our tutorials we will use the [Sepolia testnet](https://sepolia.dev/). You can get some funds by using
the [Sepolia faucet](https://faucet.sepolia.dev/).
